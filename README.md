# Background 
The gender pay gap manifests across all industry, but is especially pronounced in basketball. Recently in the [news](https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/31141363/ncaa-budget-men-basketball-tournament-almost-twice-much-women-budget), the NCAA's March Madness tournament budgeted almost double for the men's tournament than it did for the women's tournament, leaving the womens' teams without access to gym equipment, sponsorship items, and adequate facilities. This stark contrast materializes across the sports industry, especially in the salaries of WNBA players compared to that of the NBA. It is common knowledge that male athletes make more than female athletes make, but the magnitutde of that difference is often the matter of millions. A hard to justify statistic, many sportscasters and fans claim that men's sports is simply "more interesting to watch" or that the men are "better players." To determine the degree of injustice in the salaries, we examined the difference between salaries for WNBA and NBA players based on key metrics that determine player performance such as games played and points scored. This analysis helps us understand the question of ***can we predict salaries based on player performance?"** 


# Data Question

1. How are player perforamnce metrics related to salary?
2. What discrepancies are there between WNBA and NBA salaries based on player performance?
